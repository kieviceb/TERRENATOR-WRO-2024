In the chassis and 3D part, you can find all the 3D parts that made up the robot that won in Panama in the old models part.

So the chassis and the design of the car that will go to Turkey took a long time because our ideas were to make the robot of the national competition much smaller, agile, faster and prettier, so we had to make a completely new chassis, in this one changing several parts of the assembly, for example in the steering system, since in our previous robot, the steering system was based on moving a cylinder with teeth that moved a line with teeth that gave direction to the robot, the problem with this steering design was that it is a bit imprecise so, we adopted a steering design similar to the Ackerman steering, and we also changed the servo motor.

Then for the traction, we have four parts, the big gear for motor that this is the gear that give us the torque to move the robot, we have a game of gears that we can modify in case we need speed or more torque, and we have a fixed drive motor retainer, here we have a support for the motor, and we have the small gear for the drive axle, and we have the traction support.

Then we have the skeleton: 
Here in the skeleton is the main base chasis of the robot, here we can find in the physical one the motor game with his gears, the servo motor, and the modifications that make the steering have better movements.

And also here we have the main shell, here we can find all that makes our robot, here are all the circuits for the robot and the base for the camera.

Now for the sensors, we have made a lot of support for them, but with this one we made the correct one, it is more outside beacuase they give us better data in this way.

Now with the wheels, we have designed it by ourself, because in that way we can ajust eveything by ourself and it's so much better in that way. For the traction wheels they are a little bit so more big.
