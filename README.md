## Strategy

- robot movement strategy: our mobility system for the robot is powered by a single motor (POLOLU Metal Gearmotor (see list of components)), which connects our two RC wheelcar wheels through a gear, which uses a 3D printed traction system to interlock the action of the motor, that is, so that the two rear wheels have traction, to see how is the rear traction of the vehicle you can see the photos of the robot or the 3D model part in `models`. 

- Steering: The steering is handled by a servomotor, which is connected to the tires in an ingenious way, because the servomotor is connected to a cylinder (looks like a pineapple) printed in 3D that works as a gear, in other words that has as teethistos on the outside of it, this because the lower part makes contact with a plate made in 3D with enough teeth that when the cylinder or gear moves, this plate moves in the form of arc or curve, this so that the mobility of the direction and when taking the curves is accurate also at the time of calibration.  Then the plate that is connected in a form of a rectangle to two other completely flat plates without teeth, one lower and the other upper, that when moving the cylinder that moves the plate moves in the opposite direction to this one (check `models` to see the assembly). Our steering is simple but at the same time complex, but above all genious and precise.

- Wall detection:For this part it took us a lot of time to figure out a way of using the ultrasonic sensors to avoid the walls successfully, in our previous prototype we had the sensor horizontally and it gave us good lectures most of the time, but not always, thast way investigating a little further and using trigonometry we found out that position the ultrasonic sensors of the sides vertically is way more effective   <p align="right">and the main reason we were having trouble at the curves, what was happening was that the TX and RX sides, when reaching the curves, one was further ahead than the other and the pulse did not reach the same place and was sending out erroneous data, therefore when placing them vertically this does not happen, both pulses collide equally, and the signal bounces back uniformly, sending out useful data.

- Camera / object detection: For the second round, we are using a pixy cam v2, which is a useful and accurate camera for what we need, it has the advantage of having AI integrated, and well which makes it so much easier and faster for object detection.
  
**-First Challenge**
For the first challenge we use the three ultrasonic sensor to detect where te robot is using axels y points in the map, so the robot knows where it start. We divide the map onto three rails, and the robot will try to get onto the midel of each rail, that means always will finish in the starting position, to complete the 3 laps it has to turn 12 times and for that we have a counter in the code that detect when the robot complete the 12 corners and looks for the starting position, we use ultrasonic sensors, we have three sensors positioned in front and on the sides, that means the robot have the capability to make turns with more presition in least time.
For international tournament we are planning to use PID A PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) is a type of controller used in control systems to maintain a process variable (such as temperature, speed, position, etc.) at a desired value, called a setpoint. The PID controller adjusts the output of a system based on three terms: proportional, integral and derivative, each of which responds to different aspects of the error between the setpoint and the measured process variable. This allow us to have a more efficient way to make the first round in least time, we are thinking touse PID in two diferent ways, first as a subtraction between the measure of the ultraonic sensors, that means will always search for the middle o the rail, or use it as a wall follower dependind in which rail it start.


**- Second Challenge**
Now in this challenge we got the obstacles, the green blocks, red blocks and the parking spot, we found this one much harder than the other one so we decided to go with something more advance, our main component for this round is the PIXY cam, wich is an AI cam that is connected to the arduino and sets the signatures, we recorded 3 signatures in the PIXY cam "g.block", it refers to the green blocks, "r.block", it refers to the red blocks and "pkspot", that refers to the parking spot. for avoid the coor blocks, we devide de camara field of view in 9 sector using the camaras pixels, that means that depending on what sector the block is viewed the robot will make an idea of the distance from de block and where the block is positionated in the map, for every sector it will do a different movement to avoid the obstacle, that means that are 9 movements for green blocks and 9 with red blocks, with a total of 18 diferent movements. when we are trying this we foud that the program is to heavy for a normal arduino nano procesor, that´s why we diecide to use an arduino nano ESP32 for motion and measuring of distance, and a normal arduino nano only for procesing the data of the camara. We comunicate both arduino´s with i2c serial comunication between both, with arduino nano ESP32 as slave and arduino nano as master.
## Mobility strategy
Our robot is completely custom designed, thats why we decide to design their own steering for the robot, the steering we designed is made for have more precision in turns. We made a steering with a gear attached to the servo motor, at the same time the gear is over a custom design piece with theets, this allow us to make al type of turns quickly and on a precise way, this pieces are conected with the wheels that make what we call " The Sterring Wheels of the Robot".This pieces made our robot a front steering robot.
For the interNational Championship we are planning to make a 4 wheel steering motor, that meas that te robot will have direction in all there wheels, and is going to make closest turns to avoid obstacles in a better way.

For power we decided to use the POLOLU Metal Gearmotor 25Dx65L mm MP 12V with 48 CPR Encoder because it has good torque and speed, as our robot is based on 3D parts its structure is very light, which makes it go much faster, at first we decide tu use an axle bigger than the front one, but the car make drift on the turns, there´s when we notice that the back axle must need to be the same size as the front one. the motor bar is attached to a small gear, rhis gear is linked with a bigger one, this big gear is paste on a iron bar that is anckled to the back wheels that make the power of th robot. Thinking far away, we think we can use a four-wheels drive for international championship.
