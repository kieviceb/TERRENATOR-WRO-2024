## Strategy

- robot movement strategy: our mobility system for the robot is powered by a single motor (POLOLU Metal Gearmotor (see list of components)), which connects our two RC wheelcar wheels through a gear, which uses a metal bar to interlock the action of the motor, that is, so that the two rear wheels have traction, to see how is the rear traction of the vehicle you can see the photos of the robot or the 3D model part in the git hub and also the engineering journal. 

- Steering: The theme of the steering is handled by a servomotor, which is connected to the tires in an ingenious way, because the servomotor (the model of the servomotor in the components part), is connected to a cylinder printed in 3D that works as a gear, in other words that has as teethistos on the outside of it, this because the lower part makes contact with a plate made in 3D with enough teeth that when the cylinder or gear moves, this plate moves in the form of arc or curve, this so that the mobility of the direction and when taking the curves is quite accurate also at the time of calibration.  Then the plate that I mentioned is connected in the form of a rectangle to two other completely flat plates without teeth, one lower and the other upper, that when moving the cylinder that moves the plate moves in the opposite direction to this one. We can imagine it as if we had a steering system on the four wheels, for example if the two front wheels turn to the left, for there to be movement the rear wheels must turn to the right for there to be movement, it is a maximalist way of explaining it, but all this is calibrated through the code. Our steering is simple but at the same time complex, but above all ingenious and quite precise.

- Wall detection / Colors: our robot uses two mechanisms to turn around and avoid colliding with walls, we will separate them into two parts that are controlled by the Arduino, the color and distance part. The color part is controlled by a color sensor that is almost attached to the floor, and through code we make it so that if the color sensor looks first at the blue color and then the orange color, it turns to the left, and if it looks first at the orange color and then the blue color, it turns to the right. The only problem with this is that there is a risk that at a certain moment it will derail and not detect anything and go into the wall. In this case, we use our other system, which would be the ultrasonic sensors, which are like our auxiliary method of return in case the color sensor fails. We have three, arranged in a triangle, one on each side and one in front. The ones on the sides measure the distances to the sides, and the sensor in front measures in case the cart looks close to colliding with the wall in front. These two systems are integrated at the same time to make the robot or cart 100 percent autonomous when making its return. (to review how it is designed and components, you can find it in the top folders of the git hub and the engineering journal.)

-Camera / object detection: For the second round, we are using a pixy cam 2.1, which is a useful and accurate camera for what we needed, it has the advantage of being very smart and is integrated with artificial intelligence, and well, in the strategy of round 2 this will be explained in more detail.

**-First Challenge**
For the first challenge we use the color sensor to detect the orange and blue lines on te corners like traffic signals, so the robot knows when to turn. If it sees orange first and then blue it means turn to the right, if it sees blue and then orange means to turn to the left, and to complete the 3 rounds it has to turn 12 times and for that we have a counter in the code that detect when the robot complete the 12 corners and looks for the starting position, we also have ultrasonic sensors, we have three sensors positioned in front and on the sides, we used as a backup for color sensors, the robot have the capability to save the round if the color sensor don´t detect any of the colors on the floor, that means the robot is trained for make the round in three different modes.
For national tournament we are planning to use PID A PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) is a type of controller used in control systems to maintain a process variable (such as temperature, speed, position, etc.) at a desired value, called a setpoint. The PID controller adjusts the output of a system based on three terms: proportional, integral and derivative, each of which responds to different aspects of the error between the setpoint and the measured process variable. This allow us to have a more efficient way to make the first round in least time.


**- Second Challenge**
Now in this challenge we got the obstacles, the green blocks, red blocks and the parking spot, we found this one much harder than the other one so we decided to go with something more advance, our main component for this round is the PIXY cam, wich is an AI cam that is connected to the arduino and sets the signatures, we recorded 3 signatures in the PIXY cam "g.block", it refers to the green blocks, "r.block", it refers to the red blocks and "pkspot", that refers to the parking spot, so when the camera sees any of this objects in the track it automatically detects it and then the code can process it, with the PIXY cam is much easier to process images than using a normal camera with artificial vision; In the code when the camera sends the signatures it can send many at the same time so in the code there is a conditional that uses the first signature detected and executes the action all that in a three round loop, after that the robot is able to look for the parking spot and execute the function "parkeate" and finish the challenge.

## Mobility strategy
Our robot is completely custom designed, thats why we decide to design their own steering for the robot, the steering we designed is made for have more precision in turns. We made a steering with a gear attached to the servo motor, at the same time the gear is over a custom design piece with theets, this allow us to make al type of turns quickly and on a precise way, this pieces are conected with the wheels that make what we call " The Sterring Wheels of the Robot".This pieces made our robot a front steering robot.
For the National Championship we are planning to make a 4 wheel steering motor, that meas that te robot will have direction in all there wheels, and is going to make closest turns to avoid obstacles in a better way.

For power we decided to use the POLOLU Metal Gearmotor 25Dx65L mm MP 12V with 48 CPR Encoder because it has good torque and speed, as our robot is based on 3D parts its structure is very light, which makes it go much faster, at first we decide tu use an axle bigger than the front one, but the car make drift on the turns, there´s when we notice that the back axle must need to be the same size as the front one. the motor bar is attached to a small gear, rhis gear is linked with a bigger one, this big gear is paste on a iron bar that is anckled to the back wheels that make the power of th robot. Thinking far away, we think we can use a four-wheels drive for national championship.
